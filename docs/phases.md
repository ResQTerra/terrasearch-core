### **Phase 1: Foundation - Hardware Prototyping and Core Environment**

**Goal:** Establish the physical "brain" of a single Cerberus node and create a stable development environment on the target hardware.

**Key Activities:**

1.  **Select the Onboard Computer:** Choose a Single Board Computer (SBC) that will serve as the core processor.
    *   **Prototyping:** Raspberry Pi 4/5 (cost-effective, great community support).
    *   **Advanced:** NVIDIA Jetson Nano/Orin (for potential AI/ML features), or a more industrial SBC.

2.  **Set Up the Operating System and Software:**
    *   Install a lightweight Linux distribution (e.g., Raspberry Pi OS Lite, Ubuntu Server for ARM).
    *   Configure the development environment: Install Python 3, Git, and all libraries from your `requirements.txt` (e.g., `cryptography`).
    *   Clone your Cerberus project repository onto the SBC.

3.  **Power Management:**
    *   Design a power distribution system. The SBC, 5G modem, and other peripherals will need stable power from a drone's battery, typically via a Power Distribution Board (PDB) and voltage regulators (BECs/UBECs).

**Expected Outcome:** A bench-testable hardware unit that is powered on, running your Python code, and ready for peripheral integration. It can run the existing simulations using its own processor, but still with mock objects for hardware.

### **Phase 2: Core Communication - Real-World Mesh Networking**

**Goal:** Replace the simulated BitChat mesh with a functional, real-world Bluetooth LE mesh network, making it the first operational communication channel.

**Key Activities:**

1.  **Port BitChat Logic to Python:**
    *   This is a significant software task. The core mesh logic (multi-hop relaying, peer discovery) needs to be implemented in Python.
    *   Use a modern Python Bluetooth LE library like `bleak` for asynchronous I/O, which is crucial for managing multiple connections.

2.  **Implement Security Layer:**
    *   Port the Noise Protocol logic for end-to-end encryption using the Python `cryptography` library. Your `onion_routing.py` and `proof_of_relay.py` scripts will serve as the logical guide.

3.  **Develop the Mesh Driver:**
    *   Create a `MeshModule.py` that has the same class interface as your `MockMeshModule`. This new module will interact with the `bleak` library to manage the physical Bluetooth radio.

4.  **Test with Multiple Nodes:**
    *   Using at least two or three of your SBC units from Phase 1, test direct and multi-hop message passing between them.

**Expected Outcome:** A functional, secure, multi-node mesh network. You can now run `main_mesh_simulation.py` and have it use the real hardware drivers to send actual messages over the air between your devices.

### **Phase 3: Expanding Connectivity - 5G Integration**

**Goal:** Integrate the primary high-bandwidth, long-range communication channel and its associated security features.

**Key Activities:**

1.  **Select and Integrate 5G Modem:**
    *   Choose a 5G modem compatible with your SBC (e.g., via a USB or M.2 interface).
    *   Physically connect the modem and install any necessary Linux drivers (e.g., ModemManager).

2.  **Develop the 5G Driver:**
    *   Write a `Secure5GModule_real.py` that replaces the mock.
    *   This driver will interact with the modem, likely by sending AT commands over a serial port or using a higher-level API.
    *   Implement functions to get signal strength (RSSI), check connection status, and send/receive data.

3.  **Implement 5G Security Features:**
    *   Translate the logic from `imsi_privacy.py`, `base_station_authentication.py`, and `double_encryption.py` into real operations. The double encryption, for instance, would involve setting up a real VPN tunnel (e.g., using WireGuard) and then applying another layer of encryption to the data sent through it.

**Expected Outcome:** A single node can securely connect to a 5G cellular network. You can run `main_5g_simulation.py` and have it use the real 5G modem to connect to the internet and validate its security checks.

### **Phase 4: Intelligence and Orchestration**

**Goal:** Activate the `CommunicationManager` to intelligently and autonomously switch between the real mesh and 5G modules.

**Key Activities:**

1.  **Integrate Real Drivers:**
    *   In `communication_manager.py`, replace the `MockMeshModule` and mock `Secure5GModule` with the real hardware drivers developed in Phases 2 and 3.

2.  **Implement Real-Time Metrics:**
    *   Your drivers must provide real-time data. Update the 5G driver to continuously poll for signal strength and the mesh driver to report link quality and node density.

3.  **Tune the Decision Engine:**
    *   The thresholds and rules in your `_select_optimal_mode` method will need to be tuned based on real-world performance. Experiment with how signal strength fluctuations affect throughput and latency to create more robust rules.

4.  **Test Mode Switching Protocol:**
    *   Rigorously test the transition logic. When you physically move a node out of 5G coverage, does it reliably switch to mesh? When 5G becomes available again, does it switch back? This is a critical validation step.

**Expected Outcome:** A fully autonomous communication node that can switch between 5G and mesh based on real-world conditions, without human intervention. The `main_communication_manager_simulation.py` script becomes your main operational program.

### **Phase 5: Advanced Resilience - Failsafe and Satellite Modules**

**Goal:** Integrate the final two communication layers, preparing the system for the most extreme failure scenarios.

**Key Activities:**

1.  **Integrate Satellite Modem:**
    *   Select and physically connect a satellite modem (e.g., an Iridium or Swarm module).
    *   Write the corresponding Python driver to send and receive small data packets via the satellite network.

2.  **Integrate Emergency Beacon Radio:**
    *   Select a low-power radio module (LoRa is an excellent choice for its range and resilience).
    *   Connect it to the SBC's GPIO pins and write a driver to broadcast the simple, hard-coded emergency messages.

3.  **Final Integration with Manager and Recovery Protocols:**
    *   Incorporate the new satellite and beacon modules into the `CommunicationManager`'s decision logic.
    *   Link the `CommunicationBlackoutDetector` to the real drivers. If all of them report no connectivity, the `AutonomousRecoveryManager` should take over and activate the real emergency beacon.

**Expected Outcome:** A complete, multi-modal communication system with four operational and integrated communication channels, capable of extreme resilience.

### **Phase 6: Full System Testing, Deployment, and Operationalization**

**Goal:** To move from a working benchtop prototype to a hardened system that is physically integrated onto a drone and ready for real-world missions.

**Key Activities:**

1.  **Physical Integration:**
    *   Design and fabricate mounts to attach the entire assembly (SBC, modems, antennas, power system) onto a drone platform.
    *   Address challenges like weight, vibration dampening, and ensuring antennas have a clear view of the sky.

2.  **Field Testing (Executing the Plan):**
    *   Systematically execute the scenarios from `field_testing_framework.py` in real environments.
    *   Log all data (mode switches, signal strength, latency, errors) for post-flight analysis. Start in an open field and progressively move to more challenging RF environments (e.g., urban areas).

3.  **Adversarial Testing (Red Teaming):**
    *   Execute the `security_testing_framework.py` scenarios for real. Attempt to jam the mesh network's Bluetooth frequencies. Use a software-defined radio (SDR) to analyze the 5G connection.

4.  **Develop the Operator Dashboard:**
    *   Implement the `RealTimeDashboard` as a web interface or a simple command-line tool so a ground operator can monitor the health and status of the drone swarm's communication links in real-time.

**Expected Outcome:** A fully tested, validated, and drone-integrated Cerberus v0.3 system, ready for operational deployment.
